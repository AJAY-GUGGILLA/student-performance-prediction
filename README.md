# Student Performance Prediction

A Machine Learning Regression project to predict students' exam scores using demographic and behavioral features.

---

## Problem Statement

This project predicts students' **math scores** based on factors like:
- Gender
- Race/ethnicity
- Parental level of education
- Lunch type
- Test preparation course
- Reading and writing scores

It's built using Python and Jupyter Notebook with **Linear Regression**.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizations
   - Correlation heatmap
3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - One-hot encoding for categorical features
4. **Train-Test Split**
5. **Model Training**
   - Linear Regression
6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Mean Squared Error
   - R² Score
   - Actual vs Predicted Plot

##  Model Results

-  Trained a Linear Regression model
-  Evaluated using RMSE and R² Score
-  Visualized predictions vs actual values
